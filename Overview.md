# Hitman 3 Game Mechanics

These documents aim to cover the game mechanics of the World of Assassination trilogy, within the Hitman 3 launcher, in as much detail as possible. There are differences in the older iterations which will not be covered. While this aims to be comprehensive to help fill in gaps for newcomers, very basic stuff covered by the game's own tutorialisation will not be covered. The main focuses will be on the understanding of AI, gear and the detection/rating system, and how to take advantage of these in a variety of gameplay styles.
